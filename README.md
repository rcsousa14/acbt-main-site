# ACBT — Construção & Engenharia

This is the main project for the company I work for. I was trying to get started working with vue and tailwind. I found the gridsome framework easy to work it for SPA. 

###  Tools

1. Gridsome `https://gridsome.org/`
2. tailwind CSS `https://tailwindcss.com/`

### Website

`http//www.acbt.co.ao`

### Release
 * Was able to give initial features for the web app used gridsome and tailwind primarly. The experience was good but gridsome is still a new framework.
 * Was having some git problems but was able to fix them. Updated the site for 2021

 ### TODO
 * [x] optimize the site for 2021 (images, copyright, seo)
 * [] find a better design for the site
